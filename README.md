### Short Description:


This is a little Windows Batch script that extracts the audio from a video file using ffmpeg. Drag'n'drop the desired video file into the batch file and boom! You get the extracted audio as a .WAV file in the same folder. It also works for folders! Drag'n'drop a folder and it will extract the audio from each video file.


### Typical Usage Scenarios:

Example 1: You filmed a concert and have a lot of individual video files. You want to synch the horrible camera audio to your super cool mix that you recorded with a professional audio setup that probably cost a fortune. You need the audio from the vidoe files to synch it up to your good audio. You need it as .WAV to be able to quickly import it into your DAW of choice.

Example 2: You've illegally downloaded a bunch of YouTube videos with cool music in them. You only need the music. With this script you do get .WAV files, but you can use my file_to_mp3 script to get them in am MP3 format real quick.

#### Enjoy!
